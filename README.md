 Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a web vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. These scripts can steal sensitive information, perform unauthorized actions, or hijack user sessions. XSS exploits insecure input handling, enabling attackers to manipulate site behavior and compromise security.
